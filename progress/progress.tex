\section*{Introduction}

\paragraph{}Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence combine the strengths of two subfields to produce powerful hybrid agents. Such agent architectures include AlphaGo, the first computer program to play Go with superhuman ability. \cite{AlphaGo} By harnessing Deep Reinforcement Learning with classical search algorithms, hybrid architectures possess the advantages, as well as weaknesses, of both fields.

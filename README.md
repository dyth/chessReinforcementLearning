# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Chess

Version control and backup for code and text written for University of Cambridge Computer Science Tripos Part II Dissertation Project.

The project modified an existing chess engine with a PyTorch neural network such that it could be trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning to play Chess.

Repositories for the three modified chess engines are linked below.
